    "Using multiprocessing in Python, multiple processes can run simultaneously on a computer's CPU. It improves the program's performance and efficiency by enabling it to perform multiple tasks concurrently. In scientific computing, data processing, and machine learning, where multi-core CPUs can be beneficial, it is particularly useful."

    "In multiprocessing, several processes run concurrently, while in multithreading, multiple threads run within a single process. Multiprocessing runs multiple processes simultaneously using multiple CPUs or cores, while multithreading runs multiple threads concurrently using a single CPU or core. Therefore, multiprocessing is more efficient for CPU-bound tasks, while multithreading is more efficient for I/O-bound tasks, such as network communication or disk operations. In addition to this, multiprocessing is more complex and requires more communication between processes, while multithreading has fewer overheads and can share data more readily within one process."
