    "\n",
    "* **Increased interaction:** APIs enable different software systems to communicate with each other, no matter what programming language they use. This enhances interaction between systems, allowing data and functionality.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Flexibility:** API Gateways provide flexibility to use completely independent protocols allowing my microservices to communicate among themselves easily.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Security:** The API gateway encrypts sensitive API endpoints between the front end and microservices, so my sensitive API endpoints are not exposed. It also protects my API from malicious attack vectors such as DoS attacks, SQL injections, and several other attacks."

    "\n",
    "* **Single point of entry:** APIs can act as a gateway that hackers can use to gain access to a network. All applications and systems are vulnerable once the API is infected.\n",
